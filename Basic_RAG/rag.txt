SECTION 4: TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION – RAG OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an architecture that combines
information retrieval with large language models.

A typical RAG pipeline consists of:
1. Document ingestion
2. Text chunking
3. Vector embedding generation
4. Similarity search
5. Context injection into an LLM prompt

Advantages of RAG:
- Reduces hallucinations
- Improves factual accuracy
- Enables use of proprietary data

Common vector databases include:
- FAISS
- Pinecone
- Weaviate
- Chroma

Embedding models commonly used:
- OpenAI text-embedding models
- SentenceTransformers
- Cohere embeddings
